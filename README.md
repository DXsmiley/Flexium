Flexium
=======

About
-----

Flexium is a C++ game engine that sits on top of SFML.
Flexium was designed for development speed. Kinda.
Flexium was built for personal use.
You can see it in action [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=45520);

Currently, Flexium has only been tested with MinGW on Windows 7.

Installation
------------

Install SFML.
Download source code and run make.
Move stuff to the proper location and hope it works.
