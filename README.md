#Flexium

##About

Flexium is a C++11 game engine that sits on top of [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/). It is designed for development speed, rather than performance.

Flexium draws a lot of inspiration from [GameMaker](http://yoyogames.com/), although there is no GUI and it's all in C++.

Here's some examples of Flexium in action.
- [Orbitals](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=45520) - Ludum Dare 31
- [Ink](http://ludumdare.com/compo/minild-56/?action=preview&uid=45520) - MiniLD 56

##Features

- Resource management for images, sounds and fonts.
- Animation strips.
- Inheritance-based objects.
- Support for [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) maps.
- A realy cool development team. Heh.

##Installation

Install [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).
Download the Flexium source code and run make (that's GNU Make, not CMake, sorry). This will compile using `g++`.
The library can then be found in the `lib` folder. Link to it however you wish.

##Contributing

If you wish to contribute to Flexium, that would be pretty rad. You can help by contributing code (just make a github issue/ pull request) or just using the library and giving me general feedback.

*If you make something cool, be sure to tell me!*
