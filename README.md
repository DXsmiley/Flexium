Flexium
=======

About
-----

Flexium is a C++ game engine that sits on top of [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).
Flexium was designed for development speed. Kinda.
Flexium was built for personal use.
You can see it in action [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=45520).

Currently, Flexium has been tested with MinGW on Windows 7.
It also compiles on Linux Mint in a virtual box, if that's of any help.

Installation
------------

Install SFML.
Download source code and run make.
Move stuff to the proper location and hope it works.
